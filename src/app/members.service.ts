      'description': 'Sir Richard Starkey,[2] MBE (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, songwriter, singer, and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including "With a Little Help from My Friends", "Yellow Submarine", "Good Night", and their cover of "Act Naturally". He also wrote the Beatles\' songs "Don\'t Pass Me By and Octopus\'s Garden, and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \'What Goes On\' and \'Flying\', Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. In 1955, he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he cofounded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles were formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success with that band in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, when he replaced Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles\' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band\'s break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number four hit "It Don\'t Come Easy", and number ones "Photograph" and "You\'re Sixteen". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, "Back Off Boogaloo", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top ten release in both the UK and the US. He has been featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows. He also narrated the first two series of the children\'s television programme Thomas & Friends and portrayed \'Mr Conductor\' during the first season of the PBS children\'s television series Shining Time Station. Since 1989, he has toured with twelve variations of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.',
      'text1': 'Soon after Trafford piqued Starkey\'s interest in skiffle, the two began rehearsing songs in the manufacturing plant\'s cellar during their lunch breaks. Trafford recalled: "I played a guitar, and [Ritchie] just made a noise on a box ... Sometimes, he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys, or banged on the backs of chairs."[33] The pair were joined by Starkey\'s neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark.[34] The band performed popular skiffle songs such as "Rock Island Line" and "Walking Cane", with Starkey raking a thimble across a washboard, creating primitive, driving rhythms.[35] Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools. Though the lessons were short-lived, they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town.',

      'text2': 'On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a second-hand drum kit consisting of a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, who went on to book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.[36]In November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell\'s Texans, a skiffle group who were looking for someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could transition from one of Liverpool\'s best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band.[37][nb 1] They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey.[39] About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country and western influence. His drum solos were billed as Starr Time.'

      'description': 'George Harrison[nb 1] MBE (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer-songwriter, and producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as "the quiet Beatle", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles\' work. Although the majority of the band\'s songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included "Taxman", "Within You Without You", "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something", the last of which became the Beatles\' second-most covered song Harrison\'s earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)". Having initiated the band\'s embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band\'s break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass, a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, "My Sweet Lord", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor for later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles\' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founding HandMade Films in 1978',
      'text1': 'Harrison became part of the Beatles with McCartney and John Lennon when the band was still a skiffle group called the Quarrymen. McCartney told Lennon about his friend Harrison, who could play "Raunchy" on his guitar. In March 1958, Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen at Rory Storm\'s Morgue Skiffle Club, playing Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith\'s "Guitar Boogie Shuffle", but Lennon felt that Harrison, having just turned 15, was too young to join the band.[30] During a second meeting, arranged by McCartney, he performed the lead guitar part for the instrumental "Raunchy" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus.[31] He began socialising with the group, filling in on guitar as needed,[32] and became accepted as a member.[33] Although his father wanted him to continue his education, Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at Blacklers, a local department store.[34] During the group\'s first tour of Scotland, in 1960, Harrison used the pseudonym "Carl Harrison", in reference to Carl Perkins.',

      'text2': 'In 1960, promoter Allan Williams arranged for the band, now calling themselves the Beatles, to play at the Indra and Kaiserkeller clubs in Hamburg, both owned by Bruno Koschmider.[36] The impromptu musical education Harrison received while playing long hours with the Beatles, as well as the guitar lessons he took from Tony Sheridan while they briefly served as his backing group, laid the foundations of his sound and of his role within the group; he was later known as "the quiet Beatle".[37][38] The band\'s first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs.[39] When Brian Epstein became their manager in December 1961, he polished their image and secured them a recording contract with EMI. The group\'s first single, \'Love Me\' Do, peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart, and by the time their debut album, Please Please Me, was released in early 1963, Beatlemania had arrived.[41] Their second album, With the Beatles (1963), included "Don\'t Bother Me", Harrison\'s first solo writing credit.[42]The Beatles in New York City in 1964, waving to a large crowdJohn, Paul, George and Ringo arrive in New York City during the height of Beatlemania, February 1964By 1965\'s Rubber Soul, Harrison had begun to lead the other Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)".[43][nb 2] He later called Rubber Soul his "favourite [Beatles] album".[45] Revolver (1966) included three of his compositions: "Taxman", "Love You To" and "I Want to Tell You".[46] His introduction of the drone-like tambura part on Lennon\'s \'Tomorrow Never Knows\' exemplified the band\'s ongoing exploration of non-Western instruments.[47] The tabla-driven "Love You To" was the Beatles\' first genuine foray into Indian music.[48] According to the ethnomusicologist David Reck, the song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody.[49] Harrison continued to develop his interest in non-Wester',

      'description': 'John Winston Ono Lennon, MBE (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980) was an English singer, songwriter, musician, and peace activist[1] who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. He and fellow member Paul McCartney formed a much-celebrated songwriting partnership. Along with George Harrison and Ringo Starr, the group would ascend to world-wide fame during the 1960s. Born and raised in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Lennon began to record as a solo artist before the band\'s break-up in April 1970; two of those songs were "Give Peace a Chance" and "Instant Karma!" Lennon subsequently produced albums that included John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and songs such as "Working Class Hero", "Imagine" and "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)". After he married Yoko Ono in 1969, he added "Ono" as one of his middle names. Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to raise his infant son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the album Double Fantasy. A lone gunman shot and killed Lennon in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building three weeks after the album was released.Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. Controversial through his political and peace activism, he moved from London to Manhattan in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. Some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.By 2012, Lennon\'s solo album sales in the United States had exceeded 14 million units. He is responsible for 25 number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart as a writer, co-writer, or performer. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons and in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time. In 1987, he was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Lennon was twice posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame—first in 1988 as a member of the Beatles and again in 1994 as a solo artist.',
      'text1': 'At age 15, Lennon formed the skiffle group, the Quarrymen. Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by Lennon in September 1956.[32] By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a "spirited set of songs" made up of half skiffle and half rock and roll.[33] Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen\'s second performance, which was held in Woolton on 6 July at the St. Peter\'s Church garden fête. Lennon then asked McCartney to join the band.McCartney said that Aunt Mimi "was very aware that John\'s friends were lower class\', and would often patronise him when he arrived to visit Lennon.[35] According to Paul\'s brother Mike, McCartney\'s father was also disapproving, declaring that Lennon would get his son \'into trouble\' although he later allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the McCartneys\' front room at 20 Forthlin Road.[37][38] During this time, 18-year-old Lennon wrote his first song, a UK top 10 hit for The Fourmost nearly five years later.',

      'text2': 'McCartney recommended his friend George Harrison to be the lead guitarist.[40] Lennon thought that Harrison—then 14 years old—was too young. McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played Raunchy for Lennon and was asked to join.[41] Stuart Sutcliffe, Lennon\'s friend from art school, later joined as bassist.[42] Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became "The Beatles" in early 1960. In August that year, the Beatles engaged for a 48-night residency in Hamburg, Germany and were desperately in need of a drummer. They asked Pete Best to join them.[43] Lennon was now 19, and his aunt, horrified when he told her about the trip, pleaded with him to continue his art studies instead.[44] After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. Like the other band members, Lennon was introduced to Preludin while in Hamburg,[45] and regularly took the drug, as well as amphetamines, as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.',

      'description': 'Sir James Paul McCartney, CH, MBE (born 18 June 1942), is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. He gained worldwide fame as the bass guitarist and singer for the rock band the Beatles, widely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with John Lennon was the most successful of the post-war era.[2] After the group disbanded in 1970, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.McCartney is one of the most successful composers and performers of all time. More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles song "Yesterday", making it one of the most covered songs in popular music history. Wings\' 1977 release "Mull of Kintyre" is one of the all -time best-selling singles in the UK. A two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and as a solo artist in 1999), and an 18-time Grammy Award winner, McCartney has written, or co-written, 32 songs that have reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and as of 2009 he has 25.5 million RIAA-certified units in the United States. McCartney, Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr all received appointment as Members of the Order of the British Empire in 1965 and, in 1997, McCartney was knighted for services to music. McCartney is also one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$1.2 billion.',
      'text1': 'he Beatles were informally represented by Allan Williams; in 1960, the group booked its first performance at a residency in Hamburg.[25][nb 2] In 1961, Sutcliffe left the band and McCartney reluctantly became their bass player.[27] While in Hamburg, they recorded professionally for the first time and were credited as the Beat Brothers, who were the backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan on the single "My Bonnie".[28] This resulted in attention from Brian Epstein, who was a key figure in their subsequent development and success. He became their manager in January 1962.[29] Ringo Starr replaced Best in August, and the band had their first hit, "Love Me Do", in October, becoming popular in the UK in 1963, and in the US a year later. The fan hysteria became known as "Beatlemania", and the press sometimes referred to McCartney as the "cute Beatle".[30][nb 3][nb 4]',

      'text2': 'In August 1965, the Beatles released the McCartney composition "Yesterday", featuring a string quartet. Included on the Help! LP, the song was the group\'s first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved only a single band member.[33] "Yesterday" became one of the most covered songs in popular music history.[34] Later that year, during recording sessions for the album Rubber Soul, McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the band. Musicologist Ian MacDonald wrote, "from [1965] ... [McCartney] would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and de facto musical director of the Beatles."[35] Critics described Rubber Soul as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the band\'s music and lyrics.[36] Considered a high point in the Beatles catalogue, both Lennon and McCartney said they had written the music for the song "In My Life".[37] McCartney said of the album, "we\'d had our cute period, and now it was time to expand."[38] Recording engineer Norman Smith stated that the Rubber Soul sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: "the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious ... [and] as far as Paul was concerned, George [Harrison] could do no right—Paul was absolutely finicky."'
